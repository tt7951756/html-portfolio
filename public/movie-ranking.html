<h1>Best Movies according to Charlie</h1>
<h2>A list of movies I liked over the past months</h2>

<h3>Everything, Everywhere, All at Once</h3>
<p>Multi-verse family drama with great music, exploration of Chinese-American family dynamics and killer martial arts. And Michelle Yeoh, of course.</p>
<h3>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</h3>
<p>French lesbian period drama with beautiful cinematography and an incredible ending.</p>
<h3>La tortue rouge</h3>
<p>Completely dialogue-free animation film, portraying emotions in a very different way.</p>
