<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a (soon to be) MSc graduate in Evolutionary Biology, who took a break from academia to do some soul-searching.
  The result? A project to combine the great passions of my life: Biology and Art.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I did my Bachelor's in Biological Sciences at the University of Namur in Belgium, and then started my Master's in Evolutionary Biology with the MEME (Erasmus Mundus) programme.
  The throughline of all my projects has always been microorganisms, particularly eukaryotic ones and the way they interract with the environment.</p>

<h2>Art</h2>
For as long as I can remember (or at least for as long as I could somewhat confidently hold a pencil), I have been drawing.
On every surface, in every class. In high school, we were however made to choose between very distinct, non-overlapping paths,
which put me in front of the greatest dilemna. Do I choose art? Or do I choose the natural sciences? It was never a clear option to me 
that I could, in fact, combine the two. This website is my attempt to do precisely that. </p>

<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Anyone who has spent some time in Luxembourg will be familiar with the very particular multilingual aspect of life here.
  For me, that was even further compounded by a significant part of my childhood spent in a French school in the United States, which brought about several key consequences.
  For one, I am acutely aware of how language plays into our sense of cultural belonging and integration, and how people can too easily be excluded from spaces because they do not share the language.
  Second,

<h2>Skills and personality</h2>
<p>Like mentioned above, language places a prominent role in who I am as a person. It should come to no surprise that learning more languages has always been a great interest of mine,
  including programming languages. Once you know German or Luxembourgish, it is so much easier to learn other germanic languages, such as Swedish, Dutch...
  In the same way, once you learn your first programming language, your mind has been paved and prepared for the others. In my case, the journey started with R and some very rudimentary notions of Python
  during my Bachelor's. Like an obsession, I wanted to write and format all my documents with Latex. Unsurprisingly, it was a personal challenge for myself to create this website from scratch,
  teaching myself CSS and HTML in the process.
